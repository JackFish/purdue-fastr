These versions use the same random seed and random number generator for each
run, and also for GNU R and FastR. In addition, they print a sum or some
other function of the last computed result. This is useful for checking
correctness, but also it forces evaluation with lazy arithmetics of FastR.
Note that the choice of these functions depends on the random seeds and
input data (some benchmarks could produce NAs, Infs depending on the state
of the random number generator, which changes indeed after each iteration,
and the NAs/Infs may propagate to the summary).

These versions moreover use very reduced vector sizes, so that they are
useful for tracing view use sites. Indeed note that consequently the traced
view sizes will not be the same as in full benchmarks. Indeed also the
result values will be different from other versions of the benchmarks.
